# a simple mapping app

by Simon Kassel

Final project for MUSA 620: Data Wrangling and Visualization

at the risk of stating the obvious, this app designed to make mapping simple
and easy. simply connect a point or polygon geojson file from anywhere on the
internet, choose the variable you'd like to map and you're basically there.

I built this App in R using the Shiny framework. The app relies on the following
open-source packages: shiny, rgdal, ggmap, maps, ggplot2, and broom.

map basemaps come from Stamen and ui theme from bootstrap.

special thanks to Max Galka for a great semester data-related activities and to
Sean Kross for coming in and giving us a very helpful Shiny crash course√ü
